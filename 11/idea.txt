any idea what this could mean
"you must find a common multiple of all monkeys' divisors and perform a modulo to each item. In this way, you find the right worry level for dividing by the divisor of each monkey."

Without more context, it is difficult to say exactly what this statement means. However, it seems to be describing a process for finding the "worry level" of a group of monkeys based on their divisors.

Here's a possible interpretation of this statement:

The "divisors" of a monkey are the integers that can evenly divide into its "worry level". For example, if a monkey has a worry level of 12, its divisors would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
To find the "right worry level" for a group of monkeys, you must first find the common multiple of all of their divisors. This is the smallest integer that is divisible by all of the divisors of each monkey.
Once you have found the common multiple, you must perform a modulo operation on each monkey's worry level, using the common multiple as the divisor. The result of the modulo operation is the "right worry level" for each monkey.
For example, suppose you have three monkeys with the following worry levels:

Monkey 1: 10 (divisors: 1, 2, 5, 10)
Monkey 2: 12 (divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12)
Monkey 3: 14 (divisors: 1, 2, 7, 14)
To find the "right worry level" for each monkey, you would first find the common multiple of all of their divisors. In this case, the common multiple is 60, as it is the smallest integer that is divisible by all of the divisors of each monkey.

Next, you would perform a modulo operation on each monkey's worry level, using 60 as the divisor. The results would be as follows:

Monkey 1: 10 % 60 = 10
Monkey 2: 12 % 60 = 12
Monkey 3: 14 % 60 = 14
Therefore, the "right worry level" for each monkey would be 10, 12, and 14, respectively.

It's worth noting that this interpretation is based on the information provided in the statement, and it may not be accurate without further context.
